Feature: Add to cart
	Scenario: Navigate to store, add a product to the cart, click view cart link to navigate to cart and verify
		Given I'm on the Home page and I navigate to Store Page by pressing "Store" menu option
		When I click "Add to cart" button next to the product "Blue Shoes"
		Then the "Add to cart" button changes and a tick mark is shown on it
		Then "View cart" link is shown
		When I click on the "View cart" link
		Then I'm navigated to the Cart page
		When I fetch the product name and quantity
		Then the product name is "Blue Shoes"
		And the product quantity is 1


The above scenario is difficult to maintain

Dont do too many things

general thumb rule is 3 to 5 steps , or upto 8 steps for a scenario

Scenario: Add from store - give name that makes sense
