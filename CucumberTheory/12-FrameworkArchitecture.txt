Framework architecture:

Cucumber +Selenium + Rest Assured

	We have Feature files - that has gherkin
		  glue code     - Step definitions
		  Webdriver initilaized in Hooks  - we have Before hook : to initialize driver , After hook to quit driver
					WebDriver is supplied from Page Factory
					WebDriver is sent to PageObjects , PageObjects represent pages from application
					Driver Object is sent to base Page - in BasePage we initialize page factory elements
					Page Objects will be sub classes of basePage


		We create Domain Objects , create custom types to convert them from gherkin


		RestAssured - we have Requests , Add APIs , Cookies 

		We use TestContext - Dependency Injection [pico container]

		We also use common 
				config properties , Test Data(JSON) , Utilities (Faker, Jackson, Cookies , Properties) , constants
